# Final-Project - SELE_T4_B02

In this project, there is two tasks:

- Task 1:
	- JTAG:
		This consisted of interacting with a ChipKIT Uno32 board (PIC32MX320F128H microcontroller) using only its JTAG port;

- Task 2:
	- I2C:
		This uses i2c communication to get temperature values form a temperature sensor TMP175;

	- Python:
		Receives those values back to the computer and plots them with a python script.


In each file of these 3 section(2 tasks) there will be in each a READ_ME file, which explains any doubt about what each task does.

Also in this project, there is a pdf file "Final Project_SELE" where all of this information from the READ_ME's are joined, more detailed and with figures to help the understanding of the information.
