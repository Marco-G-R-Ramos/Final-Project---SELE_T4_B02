# Final Project - SELE_T4_B02

In this project, there are two tasks:

* Task 1:

	* JTAG BST - This task consisted of interacting with a ChipKIT Uno32 board (PIC32MX320F128H microcontroller) using only its JTAG port;

* Task 2:

	* I2C - This task consisted of establishing an i2c communication to get temperature values from the temperature sensing device TMP175;

	* Python - A python script was developed to receive those temperature values on the computer and plot them with a python script.

For each of these 3 sections (2 tasks) there will be a README file, which explains what each task does in further detail.

The report for this project is included in a pdf file "Final Project_SELE" where all the information from the README's are joined, more detailed and with figures aiding the information.

ATTENTION : Due to the problem with EasyEDA, we added the teacher to the member list of the Schematic/PCB.
